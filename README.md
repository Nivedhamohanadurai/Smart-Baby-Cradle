# Smart-Baby-Cradle

The benefit of this project is to monitor infant’s activities like crying, passing urine and provides solution for that by swing the cradle on its own and making an alarm sound respectively. The objective is to reduce the stress of the family members when it comes to management of baby and reaching out as a helping hand to nurture the infants. It also provides with better monitoring of baby as we make use of moisture detection sensors which would alert the parents if the baby has passed urine or even if the cradle is wet due to some reason as the moisture would affect the baby’s health. 

## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

•	The size of the cradle should be around 18 inches by 36 inches.

•	The swing of the cradle could be managed automatically as well as manually.

•	The swing should be smooth for the baby.

•	With the help of sound sensor, we should be able to detect the cry of the baby.

•	On detecting the baby’s cry, the cradle should automatically start to swing.

•	With the help of moisture sensor, we should be able to detect any moisture that is present on baby’s cradle bed.

•	If any kind of moisture is detected, an alarm sound should be triggered.

•	On triggering of alarm sound, the caretakers of baby could be alerted about the baby’s discomfort due to moisture on its bed.

•	A button would also be introduced, through which the cradle can be made to swing on the caretaker’s wish as he or she presses the button.

## NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

•	All electronic components must be kept dry at all time.

•	All electronic components shall be in enclosure.

•	All moving components shall be non-accessible by infant.

•	System must move at reasonable speed.

•	The material of the cradle should be smooth and safe.

•	The materials which are used for the project should be durable.

•	Maintenance of sensors should be easily done.

•	Alarm sound systems should work properly for long period of time without the sound getting feeble.

•	Moisture should not affect the circuit.

•	Highly insulated.

•	Alarm sound should not cause harm to the baby.

•	The cradle should be able to handle all the weights of devices and components present.

•	Smooth rocking motion.

•	It should be stable with respect to ground

## HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:

•	Arduino uno

•	Moisture sensor

•	Servo motor

•	Sound sensor

•	Processor - Intel 486/Pentium processor or better

•	Processor Speed - 500 MHz or above

•	RAM - 64MB or above

•	Hard Disk -20GB (approx.)

•	Storage Space - Approx.2MB

• Buzzer


## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:

•	Arduino IDE

##	PRODUCT FEATURES:

The Cradle Swing will be triggered as soon as the Sound sensor crosses the threshold level. The Servo Motor will help in swinging the Cradle. 
1.	Start the System. 
2.	Check if the baby is making any noise or cry. 
3.	If yes, it triggers Servo Motor which leads to swinging of the Cradle. 
4.	You can also Turn On/ Off the Cradle Swing manually.

Moisture Sensor helps in detecting whether the baby’s mattress is wet or dry. If it is detected Wet, it will be intimated to the parents through an alarm sound. This will help to keep the baby in a healthy and hygienic Environment. 
1.	Start the system. 
2.	Keep checking if the baby’s mattress is Wet. 
3.	If yes, notify the same to the parent via alarm sound.
